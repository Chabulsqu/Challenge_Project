# Codecademy Projects
### This repository contains all the practice, off-platform, challenge or capstone projects I've done in Codecademy so far

The web pages and scripts here are mostly done as a part of the Front-end engineering Path, most languages you will find will be HTML, pure CSS and JS. Please note that some web pages are better than other due to the skills I gained during the course, so be aware of bugs.
The projects, listed in chronological order, from older to newer:  

- [Cheatsheet](/cheatsheet)
- [Tea-Cozy](/tea_cozy)
- [Design System](/design_system)
- [Company Home Page](/company_home_page)
- [Responsive Club Website](/responsive_club_website)
- [Credit Card Checker](/credit_card_checker)
- [Mysterious Organism](/mysterious_organism)
- [Lodash Recreation](/lodash_recreation/)

## How to access the projects
To run any project except the ones made with Javascript alone (Credit Card Checker, Mysterious Organism and Lodash) you can simply type https://chabulsqu.github.io/Codecademy_Projects in your web browser along with the relative path of the .html file of the project. To run any purely JS based project you must install the Node.js library in your computer, this can be done simply by going to https://nodejs.org/en/ and clicking "Download". Once you have installed it, go to the main folder of the project and select Code > "download as a ZIP" to download the whole repository folder and then execute the file on your favorite code editor using node [name of the file].
